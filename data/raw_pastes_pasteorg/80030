And that racism stems from the retarded germans, who believe that a race is actually inferior.\nI personally, am possibly as far from being racist, as you could be.\nIf you knew me in person, you would be trying to explain how this post got misinterpreted for me, since I am the last person to judge anyone for their race, gender or sexual orientation. Now let me explain, why and how I wrote this post.\nIn germany, you refer to people, who act and play tough and play the \xe2\x80\x9chard guys\xe2\x80\x9d as hood niggers. Then theres the \xe2\x80\x9cgood niggers\xe2\x80\x9d, which simply means that you are a \xe2\x80\x9clad/mate/bro\xe2\x80\x9d.\nWhere I live, the \xe2\x80\x9chood niggers\xe2\x80\x9d are not black. Ask anyone around here and they will tell you, that the only guys who really act tough and kick your head in for looking stupid, are not black. Id rather not exactly say what group these people belong to, because I fear Ill be called a racist again, but this time, for pointing out that theres \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d people not behaving too nicely. Use google and type in the words \xe2\x80\x9cschl\xc3\xa4gerei jugendliche\xe2\x80\x9d and you will find out what sort of group I am talking about, if you are really curious.\nAnyway, I am being called a \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d by my black friends almost all the time. Its being used like \xe2\x80\x9cfam/bro/lad/mate/thug/homie\xe2\x80\x9d over here. Nobody who seriously wants to insult a black/coloured person, uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cNigger\xe2\x80\x9d. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they use it? Because over here, its not meant to be a humiliating word. In germany, theres a general consens, that \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d is more like youth slang / friends talking to each other using it like \xe2\x80\x9cbro\xe2\x80\x9d.\nActual racists refrain from using the word \xe2\x80\x9cNigger\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cNigger\xe2\x80\x9d is not even german.\nThe german, historic, racist term for an african male, is \xe2\x80\x9cNeger\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAnd that word, I do not use, simply because Its implying that the \xe2\x80\x9cblack race\xe2\x80\x9d is inferior.\nI do not believe in differences between races, apart from the actual difference in skin colour and some region-dependant other bodily areas (white blood cell count is different).\n\nLike I said, \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d is used in a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d way here, its not meant to be disrespectful or mock anyone.\nI had to learn \xe2\x80\x9cthe hard way\xe2\x80\x9d today, that americans would not use \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cneger\xe2\x80\x9d, but \xe2\x80\x9cnigga\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nIf I seriously wanted to insult any coloured person with that post, I would have written \xe2\x80\x9cneger\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAlso, this post was not directed even the slightest bit at coloured people. A \xe2\x80\x9chood nigger\xe2\x80\x9d is a person who behaves badly over here. And it has nothing to do with race. If you are white, steal from people &amp; hit your girl, you will still be called a \xe2\x80\x9chood nigger\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThat word doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a real racial background here.\n\nNow to the part about the females:\nAs you could possibly tell, I do not consider myself a hard guy. I would never lay hands on a woman, since that would be about the most weak thing you could probably do.\nI do simply not understand, why a mate of mine, who has been with his gf for 4 years, got dropped last month by her, for another guy named \xe2\x80\x9cMarko\xe2\x80\x9d from poland, who is known for  having gotten other people hospitalised for looking at him while he was drunk.\nNow today, I get a call from her, asking if I could tell my mate to unblock her, since she was sorry for having treated him that way. After calling a friend of hers, I found out, that he had actually taken half of her income and claims that to be his part, for doing the house work. He is unemployed, does fitness, crime and in overall, simply a bad person, which girls fall for, because of the looks.\nNow after she complained to him about taking her money, he slapped her across the face and told her to mind her own business.\n\nSo, to sum up, what I was intentionally trying to say:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea, why girls are able to overlook a guys character, because of their looks/lifestyle. To be quite frankly, I believe that decision to be very poorly thought through and that is why I cannot really feel sorry for her. Its not liked somebody she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know stole her purse and hit her. No. She decided to be with a \xe2\x80\x9ctough guy\xe2\x80\x9d because of his looks and drop her boyfriend, who she had been with for ages, because of somebodys outer appearance. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get why girls seek violent man and believe they would never lay their hands on them. Thats the last type of guy, Id be with, If i was a girl. Thats just my opinion. Nevertheless, the guy is still to blame and not her, obviously - altho her decision to be with him in the first place, was quite stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve read my other posts, you would have understood what I was trying to explain earlier.\nI will not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d again anywhere online, since It can easily be misunderstood. I will however continue to call my friends \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d (or how americans would probably say: \xe2\x80\x9cnigga\xe2\x80\x9d) since that is just what we call each other. Its nowhere near racism.\n\nIts about the context that a word is used in and not always not about the word itself.\nI do not believe in racial differences and never will.\nI do however believe, that theres a decent amount of americans on twitter, who want to make themselves a word for being \xe2\x80\x9coh so anti racist\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cso tolerant\xe2\x80\x9d.\nRead the comments yourself and think about them. I have stated from the first minute on that this word is not meant to discriminate anyone. I only found out about the \xe2\x80\x9cending difference\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9c-er\xe2\x80\x9d / \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d about 90% through the shit storm.\nI will refrain from using both words from now on on twitter, just to make sure I do not actually piss coloured people off. That was never my intention.\nAlso, think about it.\nNobody here lives anywhere near me nor knows my real ID. If I was really a racist, Id stick to what I say and defend my views. I have nothing to fear on twitter.\nSo the decision to not use these words from now on, is simply due to respect and nothing else.\n\nI hope you see now, how one single tweet, caused others to retweet part of my tweets and calling me a racist. I am really sorry to say so and you can call me a disrespectful bitch for saying this, but: The US is full of shit regarding racism. And whats even worse, is the white people trying to point their fingers at some kid who is not from the US and not a racist and calling him one. These people seem to want to start a contest about \xe2\x80\x9cwho is the least racial\xe2\x80\x9d and use me, as an example for a racist. Just read the comments yourself.\nI got support from an afro-american male from NYC, who DMed me, saying he thought my tweet was funny as fuck and that I should not continue replying to the other posts.\nHe, and maybe a fair bit more people have realised by reading my replies to the initial tweet, that I am nowhere near racist.\nJust so you know, just 2 minutes ago, a coloured guy replied to a retweet of some girl, saying he genuinely believes this to be funny.\nThen the girl tried to say, that I was being racist with that and now he seems to have changed his mind.\nI have replied to him too now and explained my situation and why this tweet has been incredibly misinterpreted by a lot of people.\nThat just shows me, that If I had written the n-word with an \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d instead of an \xe2\x80\x9c-er\xe2\x80\x9d, this whole thing would possibly not have gone down like this and people would be laughing at this post, instead of calling me a racist.\n\nI have written quite a few words now and I hope that does somewhat clarify my position.\nIf anyone (who is coloured) has seriously thought of this as an insult, then I apologise for that. It was not meant to be discriminating towards black people and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to sound racist nor anti-feminist either.</code></pre></p> <p align="right"><span style="font-size: 60%">Add a code snippet to your website: <a href="https://www.paste.org" target="_blank">www.paste.org</a></span></p> </body> </html>'
