As such, tags that worked for HTML before HTML5 should work OK (for example &lt;font&gt; to change color and font), while tags that are native to HTML5 (for example &lt;style&gt; and other CSS related) will not work.\n\nDo not forget the end tag\nSome HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some text\n\nNever rely on this. It might produce unexpected results and/or errors if you forget the end tag.\n\n90% of issues while using the embed option in the Agenda is caused by a missing closing tag. It might even lead to people being unable to connect to the event (because they cannot get to the waiting room and load its content correctly, even if the event is started). It might even corrupt the Agenda text editor in such a way you would not be able to edit this and remove the faulty line. A quick workaround is disabling the waiting room altogether. If this is a permanent event you would have to notify IT team and ask them to remove the tag from the database.\n\n\nHTML tags can be used in the following text fields:\n\nAgenda (Waiting room/Registration Page)\n\nText field (Profile page)\n\nPlease do note that if the Agenda is also included in the invitation email it would not contain HTML content in the email, only plain text (if available)\n\nMost common use cases requested by customers:\n\nEmbed videos (Youtube and Vimeo)\n\nBoth platforms have code generators that can be found under Share and both would create an iframe code to embed the video. A customer would only need to copy-paste the code into the appropriate text field.\n\nHowever, Youtube\xe2\x80\x99s generator does not include various parameters. Customers often want to have the video autoplay and/or be looped. This can be achieved by adding \xe2\x80\x9c?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1\xe2\x80\x9d after the link in the src. For example, standard code looks like this:\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOCcR24X8LY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nand the modified with autoplay and loop options would look like this:\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOCcR24X8LY?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nVimeo has more user friendly generator that includes the autoplay and loop options during the generation process.\n\nEmbed countdown timer\n\nIt is possible to create and embed a countdown timer. This is often used to bypass the issue of customers being in various time zones. A countdown timer code can be generated here:\n\nhttps://www.timeanddate.com/clocks/freecountdown.html\n\nA customer can customise the timer according to their needs, but it is a requirement to set to select \xe2\x80\x9cSecure web page (https/SSL server)\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9cSelect type of web page/server and create HTML\xe2\x80\x9d - which is not a default setting. It will not work without changing the type to https/SSL:\n\nhttp://take.ms/jGU2G\n\nAbove examples utilise iframe code.\nThis code is used to embed websites (or parts of websites) within websites. Basic iframe code looks like this:\n\n&lt;iframe src=\xe2\x80\x9chttps://lukecm.clickmeeting.com/\xe2\x80\x9d&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nsrc is an attribute that specifies the webpage/element you would like to embed. Additional attributes are:\n\nheight=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; - by default expressed in pixels, you can add % after the number for it to be expressed in percent\n\nheight and width attributes do not change the original website\xe2\x80\x99s size, but the frame through which the original site is visible on the target site. If the frame is smaller than the original then scroll bars would appear.\n\nFor example:\n\n&lt;iframe src=\xe2\x80\x9chttps://lukecm.clickmeeting.com/\xe2\x80\x9d height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nNote: style tags and CSS are not supported at all in our text fields. Those require entire website to be hosted on a server.\n\nNote 2: The option for a webpage to be embedded on another via the iframe code can be blocked on the source page. If it does not work, it is most likely blocked by the original website.\n\niframe code can also be used by a customer to embed parts of our platform on their websites. We are not blocking embedding various elements via iframe code. Customers can use this to embed registration page, profile page etc. on their website. As long as a direct link is provided it should work OK.\n\nEmbedding audio:\n\nSimilarly to videos, audio can be embedded via iframe tag. Soundcloud (www.soundcloud.com) can be used to embed it, for example. It has a code generator that can create such a code, for example:\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/24753841&amp;color=0066cc&amp;auto_play=true&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nEmbedding images:\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;html5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;HTML5 Icon&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;128&quot;&gt;\n\nsrc is a direct link to the image\nalt provides a text for an image if - for some reason - the browser cannot display the image\n&lt;img&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt;  size=&quot;3&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;This is some text!&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;This is some text!&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font face=&quot;verdana&quot; color=&quot;green&quot; size=\xe2\x80\x9c5\xe2\x80\x9d&gt;This is some text!&lt;/font&gt;\n\nface attribute is used to assign a different font. A list of basic fonts (some of which might not apply for our platform, though) can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_family_(HTML)\n\nOther tags:\n\n&lt;a&gt; The tag defines a hyperlink with href attribute. A plain text should be entered before an opening and closing tag\n&lt;a&gt;Try our free trial!&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; The tag defines a paragraph \n\n&lt;h1&gt; The tag defines a heading (which is usually larger than paragraph). Headings can have different values. &lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading; &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important\n\n&lt;br&gt; Break line - formatting such as break lines must be defined with this tag, otherwise the browser would display text as a plain text with single space separating words, regardless of your formatting:\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sample text&lt;br&gt;and another sample text&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt; has no end tag.\n\n&lt;pre&gt; The tag defines a preformatted text which preserves break lines created with enter, multiple spaces, font etc.\n\n&lt;strong&gt; Bold text&lt;/strong&gt; \n\n&lt;em&gt; Emphasized text&lt;/em&gt; \n\n&lt;mark&gt; Marked text&lt;/mark&gt; \n\n&lt;del&gt; Deleted text&lt;/del&gt;\n\n&lt;ins&gt; Inserted text&lt;/ins&gt;\n\n&lt;sup&gt; Superscript text&lt;/sup&gt;\n\n&lt;code&gt; defines a computer code. Use along with &lt;pre&gt; for better result\n\n&lt;table&gt; is used to define a table. Within the table the following tags can be used:\n\n&lt;th&gt; defines a heading\n&lt;tr&gt; defines a row\n&lt;td&gt; defines a data cell\n\nFor example:\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;10:00-10:30&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;10:30-11:00&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Presentation&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Q&amp;A session&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;John Smith&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Smith Johnson&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre></p> <p align="right"><span style="font-size: 60%">Add a code snippet to your website: <a href="https://www.paste.org" target="_blank">www.paste.org</a></span></p> </body> </html>'
