I\'m the guy that wanted to buy Primal Mana from you, i didnt want to pay your expensive high price\n22:04 [Undeadj?nny]: Why do you charge so much for things? Your prices are over-priced?\n22:04 [Basho]: I\'m not the one you think I am\n22:04 [Basho]: I don\'t sell primal manas\n22:04 [Undeadj?nny]: You\'re on my friends list\n22:05 [Undeadj?nny]: You sell enchanting mats no?\n22:05 [Basho]: ench mats yea\n22:05 [Undeadj?nny]: Why are your enchanting mats so over-priced?\n22:05 [Basho]: Because they sell \n22:05 [Undeadj?nny]: Ah I see\n22:05 [Basho]: No one does old content hence the price for those have gone up\n22:05 [Undeadj?nny]: So you charge a high unfair expensive price because you think you can get away with it\n22:06 [Undeadj?nny]: People like you that are ripping others are , you\'re forcing me to pay \xc2\xa315 for a realm transfer. I just made a lvl1 char on a high population realm and the prices are fair and not ripping you are off\n22:06 [Undeadj?nny]: There\'s no way in hell im going to buy your enchanting mats and line your pockets with my gold\n22:07 [Basho]: Because it\'s high population realm\n22:07 [Basho]: The more people do low lvl content the lower the prices\n22:07 [Basho]: Hardly anyone does it here.\n22:07 [Undeadj?nny]: You think you\'re clever, that you can charge a high price and people are &quot;FORCED&quot; to buy ur mats. Nope mate. Im not forced at all, im just changing realm and not buying ur overpriced junk\n22:08 [Basho]: No they\'re not forced. My customers are rich lazy people leveling their profs\n22:08 [Undeadj?nny]: Ive also been going round this realm btw advising others to do a realm transfer if they arent happy with the overpriced stuff on our AH :P sorry if ur sales drop haha, serves u right for being greedy and thinking u can get away with ripping people off\n22:08 [Basho]: And to be honest they\'re no unfair\n22:09 [Undeadj?nny]: Your prices are over x2.5 in many cases a lot more than that of the other servers. Unfair overpriced expensive\n22:09 [Basho]: If you mean the ones that cost like 20g each they have always been like that even when that was the active content\n22:09 [Undeadj?nny]: if you dont beelieve it, then make a char on a high population realm and see for yourself, ur prices are certainly not fair\n22:09 [Basho]: Same as for current content ench mats you pay from 10 to 850g each\n22:09 [Undeadj?nny]: Anyway I wont have to deal with greedy noobs like you soon. I\'ll be paying fair prices and not making high levels reach, especilly people like you that dont deserve it\n22:10 [Basho]: It\'s your choice if there was supply they would have undercut me\n22:12 [Undeadj?nny]: Yup, exactly. And you think becuse theres no other supply I can extort charge a high price and get away with it. Well im not putting up with it anymore. In the past week ive been forced to buy a few things from u, but no more! Doing a realm transfer tonig\n22:13 [Undeadj?nny]: Theres plenty more supply on other realms, just do a realm transfer :D\n22:13 [Basho]: True\n22:13 [Undeadj?nny]: I may even be all the mats for cvheap there, and come back here and undercut you :p\n22:14 [Undeadj?nny]: but of course then you\'d lower your price to a fair amount because you know ur prices are unfair and high\n22:15 [Basho]: It\'s your choice. I don\'t particularly overprice it and I\'ve been on this server for ages. The prices are almost the same.\n22:15 [Basho]: Some are lower even\n22:17 [Undeadj?nny]: or i could just max out my professions on that realm buy everything i need, and then come back here\n22:18 [Undeadj?nny]: pointless to come back though really\n22:18 [Basho]: You should max them out at lvl85, the income different is huge.\n22:18 [Basho]: difference* \n22:18 [Undeadj?nny]: i can get lvl525 skills at my current lvl\n</code></pre></p> <p align="right"><span style="font-size: 60%">Add a code snippet to your website: <a href="https://www.paste.org" target="_blank">www.paste.org</a></span></p> </body> </html>'
