A minotaur who doesn\'t like a life situation or employment you give him can always walk off to the jungle and hope to return with enough (name token) to be put into new circumstances, but even so, you create those too, always. And you create them with the specific purpose of bringing social problems of the Degringolade into their lives.\n\nYour starting point is your own awareness of social problems in our world. And the best ones are the small ones that are more personal to you, not the big ones like unemployment or terrorism or health care that dominate the national and global conversation. Find them by starting to pay attention to your gut reactions to news stories and movies, to stuff that plays out via the social media you use, to public interactions you have and witness among strangers, and to the interactions within the social sphere of your family and friends. Watch for things that trigger your gut that seem like social or cultural problems. \n\nThen you take these social and cultural problems and you reshape and reimagine them as a problem for gamemaster characters in the Degringolade. Include some weirdness like what you\'ve read here, unique individuals like Veil and Fist, strange entities like FriendBeast, strange cultural conventions like the women dancing for a chance to collect Ontethrukh\'s son\'s semen, vows taken under unusual circumstances that have magical effects, characters who desire impossible things.\n\nOne gamemaster character I created was a carrion bird named Kwiehmo who a villain had been feeding human flesh. He could speak with a human voice for an hour after a feeding. He told a player minotaur where to find the murdered corpse of a friend in exchange for a promise of help in getting what he wanted himself -- to be the favored pet of a beautiful woman, to eat at her table. But I could otherwise have had him desire to become human. In The Clay That Woke, neither possible desire is any more or less likely for the bird.\n\nDon\'t go gonzo with the weirdness though. Always your strange characters and creatures and weird doings should be unique to themselves and internal to your reshaping and reimagining of cultural problems into life and employment circumstances for player minotaurs. So, no hordes of zombies, and no cults, and no vast political conspiracies. There isn\'t religion or politics in the Degringolade anyway.</code></pre></p> <p align="right"><span style="font-size: 60%">Add a code snippet to your website: <a href="https://www.paste.org" target="_blank">www.paste.org</a></span></p> </body> </html>'
